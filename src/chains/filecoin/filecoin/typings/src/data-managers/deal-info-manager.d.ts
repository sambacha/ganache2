 * TODO: (Issue ganache#868) This loads all Deal CIDs and
 * then all the deals themselves into memory. The downstream
 * consumers of this manager then filters them at every time
 * it's used (i.e. filters them by DealInfo.State).
 *
 * We'll need to rework this in the future. LevelDB has a
 * `createReadStream` method that could help with some of this;
 * but David M. thinks we'll also need to add another sublevel
 * that acts as an index for deal states.
